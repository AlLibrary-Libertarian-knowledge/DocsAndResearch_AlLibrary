# AlLibrary Implementation Timeline & Milestones

_Single Developer, 3-Month MVP Timeline_

## Overview

This implementation timeline is designed for a **single developer** completing AlLibrary's MVP in **12 weeks (3 months)** as an **open source project with zero budget**. The approach focuses on essential features, community-driven growth, and leveraging the P2P nature where every user becomes a node.

## Development Philosophy

- **Single Developer Focus**: All tasks designed for one person
- **MVP First**: Core functionality only, iterate based on community feedback
- **Community Growth**: Users become P2P nodes automatically
- **Open Source**: All development transparent and community-contributable
- **Zero Cost**: No infrastructure costs, distributed by design
