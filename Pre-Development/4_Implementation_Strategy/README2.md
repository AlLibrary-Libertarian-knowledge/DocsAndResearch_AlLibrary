# AlLibrary Implementation Strategy

_Single Developer, 3-Month MVP, Zero-Cost Open Source Project_

## Overview

This Implementation Strategy provides comprehensive planning documentation for AlLibrary's development as a **single developer project** completed in **3 months** with **zero budget**. The strategy leverages open source collaboration, community-driven growth, and the viral nature of P2P networks where every user becomes a network node.

## Project Context

**AlLibrary** is a decentralized P2P platform built with Tauri v2, Rust, and SolidJS for censorship-resistant document sharing (PDF/EPUB only). The project aims to combat information manipulation and preserve cultural heritage through a "multiple faces of truth" philosophy with no community content censorship, only technical filtering.

### Single Developer Philosophy

- **Solo Foundation**: One developer can create a functional MVP in 3 months
- **Community Amplification**: Users become contributors, testers, and advocates
- **Open Source Growth**: Transparent development builds trust and contributions
- **P2P Viral Effect**: Every user becomes a network node, enabling organic growth
- **Sustainable Scope**: Manageable features for long-term maintenance

### Technology Stack

- **Desktop Framework**: Tauri v2 (Rust + Web Technologies)
- **Frontend**: SolidJS + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust 1.70+
- **P2P Network**: libp2p (Rust implementation)
- **Database**: SQLite 3 with SQLx
- **Distributed Storage**: IPFS integration

### Development Timeline: 3 Months (12 Weeks)

1. **Month 1: Foundation & Local Features** (Weeks 1-4)
2. **Month 2: P2P Features & Sharing** (Weeks 5-8)
3. **Month 3: Polish, Security & Launch** (Weeks 9-12)
