# Resource Allocation & Development Plan

_Single Developer, Zero-Cost Approach_

## Overview

This document outlines the resource allocation strategy for AlLibrary as a **single developer, open source project with zero budget**. The focus is on time allocation, free tools, and community-driven growth rather than monetary resources. This approach leverages the P2P nature where every user becomes a node, creating viral network effects.

## Philosophy

### Zero-Cost, Maximum Impact

- **No Budget Required**: All tools and services are free or open source
- **Time as Primary Resource**: Focus is on efficient time allocation
- **Community-Driven Growth**: Users become contributors and nodes
- **P2P Network Effects**: Growth accelerates as network expands
- **Open Source Everything**: Transparent development builds trust

### Sustainable Development

- **32 Hours/Week**: Sustainable pace to prevent burnout
- **Community Support**: Leverage community knowledge and assistance
- **Iterative Approach**: MVP first, expand based on community feedback
- **Self-Hosting**: Distributed architecture requires no central servers
