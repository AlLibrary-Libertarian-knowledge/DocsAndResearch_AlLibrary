# Why Tauri v2 - Desktop Application Framework

## Overview

Tauri v2 is our chosen framework for building the AlLibrary desktop application, providing cross-platform native performance with web technologies.

## Key Advantages

### 🚀 Performance & Resource Efficiency

- **Bundle Size**: Apps can be as small as 600KB vs Electron's 100MB+
- **Memory Usage**: 50-80% less RAM consumption than Electron
- **CPU Efficiency**: Native Rust backend eliminates JavaScript overhead
- **Startup Time**: Significantly faster than Electron applications

### 🔒 Security Foundation

- **Rust Memory Safety**: Built-in protection against buffer overflows and memory leaks
- **Sandboxed by Default**: Secure isolation between frontend and backend
- **Permission System**: Granular control over system access
- **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security audits for major releases

### 🌐 Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Native Binaries**: True native applications for Windows and Linux
- **System Integration**: Access to native OS features and APIs
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Leverages system webview for rendering

### 💻 Development Experience

- **Modern Tooling**: Built with modern Rust and web technologies
- **Hot Reload**: Fast development iteration
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to both Rust and JavaScript ecosystems

## Alternatives Considered

### Electron

**Rejected because:**

- Massive bundle sizes (100MB+ minimum)
- High memory consumption
- Security vulnerabilities in bundled Chromium
- Poor performance for desktop applications
- Resource-heavy for P2P operations

### Flutter Desktop

**Rejected because:**

- Immature desktop ecosystem
- Limited native system integration
- Dart language learning curve for team
- Poor PDF/EPUB rendering capabilities
- Inadequate P2P networking libraries

### Native Development (C++/Qt)

**Rejected because:**

- Separate codebases for each platform
- Complex UI development
- Limited web technology integration
- Slower development cycle
- Higher maintenance overhead

### .NET MAUI

**Rejected because:**

- Windows-centric ecosystem
- Limited Linux support quality
- Poor P2P networking capabilities
- Licensing concerns for open-source projects

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Rejected because:**

- Limited file system access
- No true P2P networking capabilities
- Browser security restrictions
- Inconsistent cross-platform behavior
- Poor offline capabilities

## Specific Benefits for AlLibrary

### P2P Architecture

- **Rust Backend**: Perfect for libp2p integration and network operations
- **System Access**: Direct file system and network access required for P2P
- **Performance**: Critical for handling large document transfers

### Document Processing

- **Native Libraries**: Access to efficient PDF/EPUB processing libraries
- **File Operations**: Direct file system access for document management
- **Security**: Safe document processing without browser limitations

### Cultural Preservation

- **Offline-First**: True desktop application for reliable offline access
- **Local Storage**: Direct database and file system access
- **Privacy**: No cloud dependencies, fully local operation

### Anti-Censorship

- **Network Freedom**: Direct network access for TOR integration
- **System Integration**: Deep OS integration for security features
- **Anonymity**: Native support for privacy-focused networking

### Security Model

- **Process Isolation**: Frontend and backend run in separate processes
- **API Control**: Explicit API definitions between frontend and backend
- **Permission System**: Granular control over system capabilities
- **Memory Safety**: Rust prevents entire classes of security vulnerabilities

### Performance Characteristics

- **Native Speed**: Rust backend operates at near-native performance
- **Efficient UI**: SolidJS provides optimal frontend performance
- **Resource Management**: Precise control over memory and CPU usage
- **Network Optimization**: Direct control over network operations

## Future Considerations

### Mobile Support

- Tauri v2 includes mobile support (iOS/Android)
- Potential for unified codebase across all platforms
- Native mobile performance with shared business logic

### Web Version

- Frontend can be deployed as standalone web application
- Shared UI components between desktop and web
- Progressive enhancement strategy

## Conclusion

Tauri v2 provides the optimal balance of:

- **Performance**: Native speed with small footprint
- **Security**: Rust memory safety and sandboxed architecture
