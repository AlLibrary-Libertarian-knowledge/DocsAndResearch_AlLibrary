I'll analyze the main idea from README.MD and provide a summary of the Docs section, focusing on the core vision and features while disregarding the development roadmap.

Core Vision from README.MD:

- A decentralized, P2P library system built with Tauri v2 and Rust
- No accounts needed - just download and share
- Focus on preserving knowledge and combating information manipulation
- Censorship-resistant repository of knowledge
- Shield for intellectual freedom and cultural preservation

Let me analyze the Docs section:

   - Ensure long-term storage

The project represents a comprehensive solution for decentralized knowledge sharing, combining modern P2P technology with a strong focus on cultural preservation and information accessibility. The technical stack is carefully chosen to provide maximum performance, security, and reliability while maintaining a simple and efficient architecture.

Would you like me to:

1. Dive deeper into any specific aspect of the documentation?
2. Analyze the technical implementation details further?
3. Explore the cultural preservation aspects in more detail?
4. Examine the security architecture more closely?
