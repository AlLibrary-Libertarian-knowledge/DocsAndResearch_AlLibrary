# AlLibrary Governance Framework

## Vision Statement

AlLibrary operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on preserving knowledge, combating information manipulation, and ensuring free access to cultural heritage. Governance decisions prioritize community consensus, technical excellence, and mission alignment.

```

### 1.2 Decision Categories

**Level 1 - Technical Implementation (Working Groups)**

- Code changes, bug fixes, performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements, documentation updates
- Protocol parameter adjustments

**Level 2 - Feature Development (Steering Committee)**

- New features, protocol changes, architecture modifications
- Content policy updates, moderation guidelines

**Level 3 - Strategic Direction (Community Assembly)**

- Mission changes, fundamental architecture shifts
- Legal framework changes, partnership agreements

### 1.3 Proposal Process

1. **RFC (Request for Comments)**

   - Submit via GitHub Issues with RFC template
   - Include problem statement, proposed solution, technical analysis

2. **Technical Review**

   - Relevant working group evaluates technical feasibility
   - Security audit for protocol changes
   - Performance impact assessment

## 2. Technical Content Filtering Framework

### 2.1 Content Standards - Multiple Faces of Truth

**Automatically Accepted Content (No Community Censorship):**

- All PDF and EPUB documents containing text and historical perspectives
- Documents representing ANY historical viewpoint or cultural narrative
- Government documents, academic papers, and institutional archives
- Personal memoirs, diaries, letters, and firsthand accounts
- Cultural heritage materials and traditional knowledge from any community
- Conflicting historical narratives and alternative perspectives
- Educational materials from any ideological or cultural background

**Technical Filtering Only (Automated, Non-Negotiable):**

- Non-PDF/EPUB file formats (rejected automatically)
- Files containing executable code, JavaScript, or active content
- Files with embedded malware, viruses, or security threats
- Pornographic or sexually explicit visual content (image analysis)
- Files that fail cryptographic integrity verification
- Corrupted or unreadable files

### 2.2 Automated Processing Pipeline

**Upload Processing (Rust Backend)**

```rust
pub struct ContentFilter {
    pub async fn process_upload(&self, file: UploadedFile) -> FilterResult {
        // 1. Format validation (PDF/EPUB only)
        self.validate_format(&file)?;

        // 2. Security scanning (malware, executable content)
        self.scan_security_threats(&file)?;

        // 3. Content type verification (text documents only)
        self.verify_document_content(&file)?;

        // 4. Strip JavaScript and active content
        self.sanitize_document(&file)?;

        // 5. Generate content hash and metadata
        Ok(FilterResult::Accepted(file))
    }
}
```

**No Community Voting or Banning:**

- Content cannot be removed by community vote
- No reputation-based content blocking
- No expert panels deciding on historical validity
- Users choose what to download, not what others can share

### 2.3 User-Controlled Access

**Individual Choice, Not Community Censorship:**

- Users filter their own search results by topic/keyword preferences
- Optional personal content filters (user-configurable)
- Metadata tagging for content discovery (not censorship)
- Local content curation tools (personal libraries, not network-wide bans)

## 3. Contributor Framework

### 3.1 Contribution Types

**Code Contributors**

- Core protocol development (Rust/libp2p)
- Frontend development (SolidJS/Tauri)
- Security auditing and testing
- Documentation and API development

**Content Contributors**

- Digital archive curation and preservation
- Historical document verification and metadata
- Cultural context and translation services
- OCR and digitization quality assurance

**Community Contributors**

- User support and documentation
- Technical education and tutorials
- Community outreach and onboarding
- Translation and internationalization

### 3.2 Contribution Recognition

**Technical Contribution Tracking**

- Cryptographic contribution signatures for code commits
- Public contributor profiles for transparency (no voting power)
- Recognition badges for technical contributions only
- No weighted influence over content decisions

**Incentive Mechanisms**

- Technical advancement and skill development
- Open-source portfolio building
- Community recognition for technical excellence
- Equal access to all content regardless of contribution level

### 3.3 Onboarding Process

1. **Contributor Agreement**

   - Sign open-source contribution license
   - Agree to community code of conduct
   - Understand content standards and legal requirements

2. **Skill Assessment**

   - Technical interview for code contributors
   - Cultural expertise verification for content curators
   - Training program for moderation volunteers

3. **Mentorship Program**
   - Experienced contributors guide newcomers
   - Structured learning paths for different contribution types
   - Regular feedback and skill development

## 4. Technical Governance

- Backward compatibility requirements
- Security-first development practices
- Formal verification for critical components
- Staged rollout with network consensus

**P2P Network Changes**
