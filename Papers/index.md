- Handling sensitive/sacred content using an information-only model
- Attribution, consent, and community voices in metadata and narratives

## Governance and community operations

- Lightweight governance models: deliberation, consent, and transparency
- Moderation in decentralized systems: processes, escalation, and appeals
- Abuse mitigation vs freedom of expression: norms, tooling, and education
- Contributor onboarding, roles, incentives, and recognition systems

## Legal and compliance in practice

- Takedown processes (e.g., DMCA) in P2P settings: workflows and safeguards
- Jurisdictional conflicts and user risk mitigation in global networks
- Licensing education (Creative Commons) and default choices for contributors
- Data protection and privacy UX for local-first, P2P applications

## Accessibility and inclusion

- Low-bandwidth and intermittent-connectivity design patterns
- Screen reader affordances within desktop webviews (NVDA/JAWS) and keyboard-first UX
- Script coverage, font fallback, and RTL support in knowledge apps
- Cognitive accessibility for long-form reading, annotations, and dense UIs

## Education and pedagogy

- Classroom and university use cases for decentralized archives
- Information literacy curricula leveraging provenance and verification features
- Annotation as a learning activity: prompts, rubrics, and peer feedback
- Measuring learning outcomes and research skills development

## Adoption and field research

- User research in libraries, schools, and community centers
- Barriers to adoption and trust-building strategies in diverse contexts
- Offline-first workflows for constrained environments (power, bandwidth, devices)
- Success metrics and impact evaluations grounded in community goals

## Archival practice and community stewardship

- Community archiving methods: consent, attribution, and representation
- Selecting, describing, and preserving local materials with minimal resources
- Ethical digitization guidelines and cultural protocols
- Sustainability models for community-run archives and nodes

## UX for knowledge work

- Knowledge graph comprehension for non-experts and progressive disclosure
- Search and filtering UX for very large personal and community libraries
- Annotation/quoting workflows and shareable, verifiable references
- Credibility metadata and provenance surfaced without overwhelming users

## Global equity and the digital divide

- Device and power constraints: durability, portability, and resilience
- Community-run nodes: ownership, maintenance, and training models
- Multilingual UX research priorities and culturally responsive interfaces

## Measurement and community monitoring

- Privacy-preserving, opt-in telemetry frameworks for desktop apps
- Community dashboards that respect agency and minimize surveillance risks
- Qualitative feedback loops and continuous community research practices
