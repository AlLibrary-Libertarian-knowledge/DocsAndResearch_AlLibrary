# Phase 4: Collaboration Features

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on implementing collaboration features to enable users to work together effectively within the AlLibrary system, including sharing, commenting, and real-time collaboration tools.

## Duration

- Estimated Time: 4 weeks
- Start: Week 13
- End: Week 16

## Main Goals

1. **Sharing System**

   - Implement document sharing
   - Create permission management
   - Develop sharing analytics

2. **Collaboration Tools**

   - Build real-time collaboration features
   - Implement commenting system
   - Create collaboration workspace

3. **User Management**
   - Develop user roles and permissions
   - Create user profiles
   - Implement access control

## Key Deliverables

- Document sharing system
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Commenting system
- User management system
- Permission controls

## Technical Requirements

- Real-time communication system
- User authentication
- Permission management
- Collaboration engine
- UI components for collaboration

## Success Criteria

- Sharing system works reliably
- Real-time collaboration functions smoothly
- Comments can be managed effectively
- User roles and permissions work correctly
- Collaboration features are intuitive

## Execution Blueprint (Append-Only)

1) Sharing & Collaboration Surfaces
- Implement share UI and commenting using domain/composite patterns; persist via services.
- Real-time layer scoped to desktop constraints (Tauri IPC + optional P2P events later).

2) User/Permission Model (Technical)
- Define local user profiles for personalization only; do not implement cultural-based access control.
- Permissions here are technical feature toggles (not cultural gates).

## Integration Map

- Pages: DocumentDetail (comments), Collections (shared views), PeerNetwork (presence UI later).
- Components: CommentList, ShareDialog, ActivityFeed.

## Acceptance Criteria (Phase 4)

- Comments persist, render, and are editable; offline-friendly queues.
- Share links or peer notifications function within P2P constraints; audit trail present.
- No cultural restriction logic; cultural context shown as info in collaboration surfaces.

## Test Plan

- Unit: comment model, share payloads, optimistic UI.
- Integration: comment lifecycle, share flows.
- E2E: comment add/edit/delete, share-and-open scenario.

## Performance Budgets

- Comment post latency < 200ms (local), UI updates < 50ms.

## Cultural Info-Only Guardrails

- Collaboration features must not introduce cultural approval workflows; show educational context only.
