# Phase 5: Integration & API

## Overview

Phase 5 focuses on developing integration capabilities and APIs to allow AlLibrary to interact with other systems and services, enabling extensibility and automation.

## Duration

- Estimated Time: 4 weeks
- Start: Week 17
- End: Week 20

## Main Goals

1. **API Development**

   - Create RESTful API
   - Implement API documentation
   - Develop API security

2. **Integration System**

   - Build integration framework
   - Create plugin system
   - Implement webhook support

3. **Automation Tools**
   - Develop automation framework
   - Create workflow system
   - Implement scheduled tasks

## Key Deliverables

- RESTful API
- API documentation
- Integration framework
- Plugin system
- Automation tools

## Technical Requirements

- API development tools
- Authentication system
- Integration framework
- Plugin architecture
- Automation engine

## Success Criteria

- API is well-documented and secure
- Integrations work reliably
- Plugins can be developed and installed
- Automation tools function as expected
- System is extensible and maintainable

## Execution Blueprint (Append-Only)

1) Security & Anti‑Censorship Integration
- TOR integration for transport selection; document how to enable in settings.
- Harden Tauri IPC + Rust commands; input sanitization audit.

2) API/Integration Scope
- Local-first API surface (Tauri commands) and plugin hooks; no centralized services.

## Integration Map

- Services: security/validation, network/tor, plugin system.
- Settings page: controls for security and transport options.

## Acceptance Criteria (Phase 5)

- TOR transport works; connection fallback logic verified.
- Security scans automated in CI; no high vulnerabilities.
- APIs documented and typed; samples included.

## Test Plan

- Security tests: injection, path traversal, IPC misuse.
- Network tests: route via TOR vs direct.

## Performance Budgets

- TOR overhead documented; app remains usable with < 2× latency for network ops.

## Cultural Info-Only Guardrails

- Security/legal checks remain technical; cultural content is never filtered.
