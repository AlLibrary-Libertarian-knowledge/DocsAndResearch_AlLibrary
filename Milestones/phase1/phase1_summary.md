# Phase 1: Foundation & Architectural Restructuring

## Overview

**UPDATED**: Phase 1 has been restructured to address critical architectural violations and establish proper SOLID foundation with mandatory cultural and security integration.

## Duration

- **Updated Estimate**: 2-3 weeks intensive restructuring
- **Start**: Week 1 (Architectural Restructuring)
- **End**: Week 3 (Infrastructure Complete)

## Main Goals

1. **Architectural Restructuring** (Week 1)

   - Fix component hierarchy violations (foundation → domain → composite → pages)
   - Implement mandatory directory structure per coding rules
   - Establish SOLID principles throughout codebase
   - Create proper TypeScript strict mode enforcement

2. **Cultural & Security Infrastructure** (Week 2)

   - Implement 5-level cultural sensitivity system
   - Create cultural validation and protection mechanisms
   - Establish comprehensive input validation pipeline
   - Integrate malware scanning and content protection

3. **Service Layer & Database Integration** (Week 3)
   - Build comprehensive service architecture following SOLID principles
   - Implement cultural metadata database schema
   - Create security validation services
   - Prepare P2P and anti-censorship foundation

## Key Deliverables

- **SOLID-compliant architecture** with proper component hierarchy
- **Cultural framework** with 5-level sensitivity system and protection mechanisms
- **Security infrastructure** with 100% input validation and content protection
- **Service layer** following coding rules with cultural integration
- **Enhanced database** with cultural metadata and access logging

## Technical Requirements

- **Immediate**: Architectural restructuring (cannot proceed without this)
- **Cultural Advisory**: Community consultation for cultural framework validation
- **Security Review**: External validation of security pipeline
- **TypeScript Strict**: >95% coverage enforcement
- **Testing Framework**: >80% coverage with cultural and accessibility tests

## Success Criteria

### Architectural Compliance

- Component hierarchy follows foundation → domain → composite → pages exactly
- All mandatory directories exist and properly structured
- SOLID principles enforced throughout codebase
- > 80% component reusability achieved

### Cultural Integration

- 5-level cultural sensitivity system implemented and active
- Cultural validation integrated into all content operations
- Sacred content protection mechanisms functional
- Community sovereignty respected in all operations

### Security Implementation

- 100% input validation coverage achieved
- Malware scanning integrated and operational
- Content sanitization functional for all inputs
- Anti-censorship architecture prepared

### Code Quality

- > 95% TypeScript strict mode coverage
- All components follow established patterns
- Quality gates implemented and enforced
- Documentation standards met

## Updated Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks Addressed

- **Architectural Violations**: Must be fixed before proceeding
- **Cultural Insensitivity**: Framework prevents cultural harm
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive validation prevents attacks
- **Technical Debt**: SOLID principles prevent accumulation

### Success Dependencies

- **Community Engagement**: Cultural framework requires community input
- **Security Expertise**: Validation pipeline needs security review
- **Development Discipline**: Must maintain standards throughout project
- **Testing Rigor**: Comprehensive testing prevents regressions

## 🚨 PHASE 1 PRIORITY ALERT

**This phase MUST be completed before any new feature development:**

- **Week 1**: Architectural restructuring (CRITICAL PATH)
- **Week 2**: Cultural and security infrastructure (MANDATORY)
- **Week 3**: Service layer and database integration (FOUNDATION)

**Previous "100% Complete" status invalidated** - comprehensive restructuring required.

**All future phases depend on this foundation** - no shortcuts permitted.

## Execution Blueprint (Append-Only)

1) Restructure Components & Imports
- Enforce directory hierarchy: foundation → domain → composite → pages.
- Add `index.ts` barrel exports in all component/service/store dirs; switch to absolute `@/` imports.
- Extract types to `src/types/` and ensure strict typing throughout.

2) Cultural Framework (Information-Only)
- Implement cultural context services/hooks that provide educational context, sources, and sensitivity indicators.
- Add `CulturalIndicator` UI elements to domain/composite components for information display.
- IMPORTANT: No access control or approval gates; all cultural features are informational only.

3) Security Validation Pipeline
- Input validation utilities (type, length, sanitizer) and malware scanning on file imports.
- Legal-compliance checks (copyright/malware) only; explicitly exclude cultural gating.
- Integrate into Tauri commands with error propagation; add CI job to run validations on tests.

4) Service Layer & Stores
- Create typed API/service interfaces per guide; wire stores to services; remove ad-hoc fetches.
- Add error boundaries and loading states referencing foundation `Loading` component.

## Integration Map

- Architecture: `00_DEVELOPMENT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` (SOLID patterns, service layer), `04_System_Architecture_Diagrams.md`.
- Pages to touch: Home, Search, MyDocuments, Collections, CulturalContexts (indicators only).
- Types/Stores/Services: unify under `src/types`, `src/stores`, `src/services` with barrels.

## Acceptance Criteria (Phase 1)

- Directory structure and barrels complete; no relative deep imports.
- TypeScript strict coverage ≥ 95%; ESLint clean; Prettier formatted.
- Cultural context components and services render informational context only.
- Security pipeline: input validation + malware + legal-only checks integrated and tested.
- Tests ≥ 80% across touched modules; a11y checks on updated components.

## Test Plan

- Unit: validators, cultural context mappers, service interfaces, store actions.
- Integration: component hierarchy rendering, cultural indicators rendering, validation errors.
- E2E: app smoke, navigation, cultural information visibility with no access blocking.

## Performance Budgets

- Initial load < 2s; navigation < 500ms; complex components render < 100ms.
- Memory < 100MB typical; no leaks (run basic leak checks during tests).

## Cultural Info-Only Guardrails (Critical)

- Replace any notion of “approval”, “permission”, or “gate” in cultural features with educational messaging and provenance display.
- If existing docs mention gates/approvals, interpret as “present information and suggested learning materials” only.

## Progress Tracking

- Update `progress/Project_Progress.md`, `progress/Current_Task.md`, `progress/Recent_History.md` for each restructuring milestone.
- Record KPIs: TS coverage, test coverage, lint status, render timings.
