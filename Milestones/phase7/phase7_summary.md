# Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

## Overview

Phase 7 focuses on comprehensive testing and quality assurance to ensure the AlLibrary system is reliable, secure, and meets all requirements.

## Duration

- Estimated Time: 4 weeks
- Start: Week 25
- End: Week 28

## Main Goals

1. **Testing Framework**

   - Implement unit testing
   - Create integration tests
   - Develop end-to-end tests

2. **Quality Assurance**

   - Perform security testing
   - Conduct performance testing
   - Implement automated testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Create user documentation
   - Develop API documentation
   - Write technical documentation

## Key Deliverables

- Comprehensive test suite
- Security audit reports
- Performance test results
- User documentation
- Technical documentation

## Technical Requirements

- Testing frameworks
- Security testing tools
- Performance testing tools
- Documentation tools
- CI/CD pipeline

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass successfully
- Security vulnerabilities are addressed
- Performance meets requirements
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- System is production-ready

## Execution Blueprint (Append-Only)

- Establish test matrix: unit/integration/e2e/a11y/perf/security.
- Enforce coverage gates in CI; generate reports; link to progress docs.

## Integration Map

- Tests across components, pages, services, tauri commands.
- Docs: API/user/technical guides under `Docs/`.

## Acceptance Criteria (Phase 7)

- Tests > 85%; TypeScript strict > 95%; a11y AA; perf budgets met; security checks pass.

## Test Plan

- E2E flows for Screens pages; a11y assertions; perf thresholds.

## Cultural Info-Only Guardrails

- Add tests asserting cultural information is displayed and never blocks access.
