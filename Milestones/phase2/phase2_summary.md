## Detailed Goals

### 1. Foundation Component Library

#### Core UI Components

```
src/components/foundation/
├── Button/                    # All button variants with cultural themes
├── Input/                     # Form inputs with validation integration
├── Card/                      # Content cards with cultural indicators
├── Modal/                     # Dialogs with cultural access gates
├── LoadingSpinner/            # Loading states with cultural context
├── CulturalIndicator/         # Sensitivity level display
├── SecurityBadge/            # Content security status
└── AccessibilityHelper/       # A11y enhancement tools
```

#### Component Standards

- **Cultural Integration**: Every component supports cultural themes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory
- **Security**: Input validation integrated at component level
- **Theming**: Support for cultural color schemes and accessibility modes
- **Testing**: >80% coverage including cultural scenarios

### 2. Document Management System

#### Document Operations with Cultural Awareness

```typescript
// Document Service Integration (builds on Phase 1)
const documentOperations = {
  import: async (file: File) => {
    // 1. Security validation (malware scan)
    // 2. Cultural sensitivity analysis
    // 3. Community notification (if required)
    // 4. Storage with cultural metadata
  },
  view: async (docId: string, userId: string) => {
    // 1. Cultural access validation
    // 2. Educational requirement check
    // 3. Community permission verification
    // 4. Controlled content delivery
  },
};
```

#### Cultural Document Features

- **Sensitivity Classification**: Automatic analysis plus manual override
- **Access Controls**: Educational requirements, community permissions
- **Protected Preview**: Graduated access based on cultural level
- **Community Integration**: Notification and approval workflows

### 3. Search & Organization Foundation

#### Culturally-Aware Search

```typescript
// Search with Cultural Context
const searchWithCulturalContext = {
  searchLocal: async (query: string, userId: string) => {
    // 1. User cultural access level check
    // 2. Filter results by cultural permissions
    // 3. Provide educational context for restricted content
    // 4. Log cultural access attempts
  },
};
```

#### Organization Features

- **Cultural Collections**: Group by cultural origin, sensitivity level
- **Educational Pathways**: Organize learning materials by cultural context
- **Community Spaces**: Virtual spaces for cultural communities
- **Sacred Content Areas**: Special handling for highest sensitivity content

## 🌍 CULTURAL INTEGRATION NOTICE

**Phase 2 establishes the first user-facing cultural framework:**

- **Every component** respects cultural sensitivities
- **Every document operation** validates cultural permissions
- **Every search** honors cultural access controls
- **Every interaction** provides educational opportunities

**This phase proves that technology can enhance rather than harm cultural preservation.**

## Execution Blueprint (Append-Only)

1) Foundation Components
- Build Button, Input, Card, Modal, Loading, CulturalIndicator, SecurityBadge with typed props and a11y attributes.
- Add CSS modules + tokens; cultural variants are visual only.

2) Document Management (Security First)
- Import pipeline: sanitize metadata → malware scan → legal check → persist with cultural metadata (information fields only).
- Viewer: educational context panel, sensitivity indicators; no cultural access checks.

3) Search & Organization
- Local search using SQLite FTS; display cultural context columns; filters are informational labels.
- Collections: grouping by cultural attributes for learning; no restrictions.

## Integration Map

- Pages: MyDocuments, DocumentDetail/Reader, Collections, Search.
- Components: foundation + domain/document cards, lists, actions; add `CulturalIndicator`.
- Services: `documentService`, `collectionService`, validation services; i18n strings for labels.

## Acceptance Criteria (Phase 2)

- Foundation components pass a11y checks; >80% test coverage.
- Import pipeline enforces malware/legal checks; cultural metadata saved as info-only.
- Document viewer shows cultural context panel; no access blocking.
- Local search returns within 500ms on typical dataset; filters affect labels/ordering only.

## Test Plan

- Unit: component props, validators, metadata mappers.
- Integration: import → persist → view path; search → results → viewer link.
- A11y: role/aria coverage for foundation components; keyboard nav.

## Performance Budgets

- Import processing overhead: < 300ms per file (excluding IO).
- Search response: < 500ms; pagination ≥ 20 items per page.
- Viewer interaction latency: < 50ms for panel toggles.

## Cultural Info-Only Guardrails (Overrides)

- Any references above to “access controls”, “permissions”, “approval”, or “gates” are superseded by project rules: cultural features are informational and educational only; no access restriction logic may be implemented.
- Provide learning links/resources and provenance; log events for analytics only.

## Progress Tracking

- Track: number of components completed, a11y checklist pass rate, import pipeline tests, search timings.
- Update progress files per workflow guide.
