# Phase 6: Performance & Optimization

## Overview

Phase 6 focuses on optimizing the AlLibrary system's performance, implementing caching strategies, and ensuring the application runs efficiently at scale.

## Duration

- Estimated Time: 4 weeks
- Start: Week 21
- End: Week 24

## Main Goals

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement caching system
   - Optimize database queries
   - Improve search performance

2. **Resource Management**

   - Optimize memory usage
   - Implement resource pooling
   - Create performance monitoring

3. **Scalability**
   - Implement load balancing
   - Create scaling strategies
   - Optimize concurrent operations

## Key Deliverables

- Caching system
- Optimized database operations
- Performance monitoring tools
- Resource management system
- Scaling solutions

## Technical Requirements

- Caching framework
- Performance monitoring tools
- Resource management system
- Load balancing tools
- Optimization tools

## Success Criteria

- System performs efficiently under load
- Caching reduces response times
- Resource usage is optimized
- System can scale effectively
- Performance metrics meet targets

## Execution Blueprint (Append-Only)

- Apply `optimization/` guides: canvas optimization, code splitting, memory management.
- Add monitoring: FPS/memory/load metrics toggled in dev.

## Integration Map

- Components: NetworkGraph optimization (use `src/utils/performance.ts`).
- Router: lazy routes per `optimization/code-splitting-guide.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria (Phase 6)

- Initial bundle reduced per targets; route loads < 200ms typical.
- NetworkGraph 60fps sustained on target dataset.

## Test Plan

- Bundle size tests; loading performance tests (see guide).
- Canvas perf integration tests for NetworkGraph.

## Performance Budgets

- Bundle < 250KB initial; TTI < 1.5s; memory < 50MB idle.

## Cultural Info-Only Guardrails

- Visual themes may include cultural variants; remains informational only.
